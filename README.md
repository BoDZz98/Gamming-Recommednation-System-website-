MY GRADUATION PROJECT
A Gaming Recommendation System
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a gaming enthusiast, I understand how challenging it can be to find the right game to play. That's why I created this website to help gamers discover new and exciting games based on their preferences. With the advanced recommendation system, users can find games that fit their unique playing style, making the gaming experience more enjoyable.

In this video, I'm excited to share with you my latest project - a gaming recommendation system built from scratch using PHP Laravel framework and MVC architecture. The front end was developed using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine JS for user interactions, without using any ready-made templates. To gather the game data, I utilized an API called IGDB which contains all the necessary information. However, due to slow API responses, I used Livewire components and cache in the backend to improve performance. The database was created using MySQL in phpMyAdmin. Finally,  the recommendation model was integrated with the website using Flask.

NOTE: The recommendation model itself and the integration using Flask, wasn't done by me. It was done by my colleague Omar Emad.
